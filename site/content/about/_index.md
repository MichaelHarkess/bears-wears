      Bear believes in strength through kindness. And back scratching on trees. 
      And as such makes kind, durable hand died garments, best suited for losing 
      time in the woods, with the clan or lone foraging.  Bears cub can agree that 
      he is best suited to the woods, against his favorite tree.

      Bear was a professional chef working in the high paced world of the kitchen, 
      after the birth of his cub, he began to take life at a slower pace, spending 
      time in his colourful cave and woods with his loved ones. Twisting and tieing 
      garments for their enjoyment.

      Now a few of his buddies have helped him out of the woods on on to the internet, and maybe just into your weekly rotation.
      Bear prices his work based on the time and skill of each unique piece, and the materials he selects for the process. 
      Custom tie-dies and collaborations with friends; other textile producers and design brands
